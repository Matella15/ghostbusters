# Step 4: Adding a score

Let's make things more interesting by keeping score.

## Activity Checklist

+ Can you keep track of the player's score? Player's should score points by clicking on ghosts to catch them.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
__When the green flag is clicked__ a score __variable__[link??] should be set to 0. __When the ghost sprite is clicked__, the __score__ should be changed by 1.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
Here are the code blocks you will need to use: ...[todo]
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
[Is this where the link to the 'keeping-score' mini-project goes? If so, will this be specific enough for this (and all other) tasks?]
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }
