## Step 2: Random ghosts

Your ghost is really easy to catch, because it doesn't move!

+ Instead of staying in the same position, can you code your ghost to appear in random positions on the screen?

    Test and save.

You want your ghost to __go to__ a random position on the stage before appearing each time.

You could use either of these sets of code blocks:

## Challenge: More randomness
Can you make your ghost `wait` a random amount of time before appearing? Can you use the `set size` block to make your ghost a random size each time it appears?
