## Adding a score

Let's make things more interesting by keeping score.

+ Create a new variable called 'score'.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

+ Can you keep track of the player's score? Player's should score points by clicking on ghosts to catch them.

    Test and save: Each time you click on a ghost, the player's score should increase.

__When the green flag is clicked__ your 'score' __variable__ should be set to 0. The __Stage__ is the best place to add this code. __When the ghost sprite is clicked__, the __score__ should be changed by 1.
