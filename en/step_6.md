## Step 5: Adding a timer

### Activity Checklist

+ Create a new variable called 'time'.

##### 'Creating a new Scratch variable' ingredient (collapsable).
[[[scratch-add-variable]]]

+ Can you give your player 10 seconds to catch as many ghosts as possible?

	Add the timer to the __stage__. This is how the timer should work:

	+ The timer should start at 10 seconds;
	+ The timer should count down every second;
	+ The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
__When the green flag is clicked__ your time __variable__ should be set to 10. It should then __change by -1__ every second __until__ it reaches 0.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
Here are the code blocks you will need to use:

{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how to add a 10 second timer to your game:

{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score? If your game is too easy, you can:

	+ Give the player less time;
	+ Make the ghosts appear less often;
	+ Make the ghosts smaller.

	Test your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
