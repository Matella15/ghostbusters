# Step 1: Animating a ghost

## Activity Checklist

[[[new-scratch-project]]]

+ Add in a new ghost sprite, and a suitable stage backdrop.

+ Would the following be better as hyperlinks, rather than additional inline content?

[[[add-sprite-from-library]]]

[[[backdrop-from-library]]]

+ Add code to your ghost, so that it repeatedly appears and disappears.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
Once the __green flag is clicked__, you'll need to make your ghost __hide for 1 second__ and then __show for 1 second__. It will need to repeat this __forever__.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
Here are the code blocks you'll need:
![screenshot](images/ghost-appear-blocks.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how your code should look:
![screenshot](images/ghost-appear-code.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ Test out your ghost's code, by clicking the green flag. Should this be a mini-project, dealing with testing, debugging, etc.? Also, where should these test steps go? It seems silly to put them here, in the step _after_ the code has been written.

## Save your project

# Step 2: Random ghosts

Your ghost is really easy to catch, because it doesn't move!

## Activity Checklist

+ Instead of staying in the same position, can you code your ghost to appear in random positions on the screen?

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
You want your ghost to __go to__ a random position on the stage before appearing each time.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You could use either of these code blocks:
Either:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-1.png)
Or:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-2.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how your code should look:
Either:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-1.png)
Or:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-2.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }
