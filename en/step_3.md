# Step 2: Random ghosts

Your ghost is really easy to catch, because it doesn't move!

## Activity Checklist

+ Instead of staying in the same position, can you code your ghost to appear in random positions on the screen?

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
You want your ghost to __go to__ a random position on the stage before appearing each time.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You could use either of these code blocks:
Either:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-1.png)
Or:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-2.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how your code should look:
Either:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-1.png)
Or:
![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-2.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ Test our your ghost again, and you should notice that it appears in a different place each time.

## Challenge: More randomness
Can you make your ghost `wait` a random amount of time before appearing? Can you use the `set size` {.blocklooks} block to make your ghost a random size each time it appears?
