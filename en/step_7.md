## Challenge: More objects
Can you add in other objects to your game?

![screenshot](images/ghost-final.png)

You'll need to think about the objects you're adding. Think about:

+ How big is it?
+ Will it appear more or less often than the ghosts?
+ What will it look/sound like when it has been caught?
+ How many points will you score (or lose) for catching it?

If you need help adding another object, you can reuse the steps above!
