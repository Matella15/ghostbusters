## Adding a timer

+ Create a new variable called 'time'.

+ Can you add a timer to your Stage to give your player only 10 seconds to catch as many ghosts as possible?

	 Your timer should:

	+ start at 10 seconds
	+ count down every second
	
	The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

`When the green flag is clicked`, your `time` variable should be `set to 10`. It should then `change by -1` every second `until it reaches 0`.

+ Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score?
	
	If your game is too easy, you can:

	+ give the player less time
	+ make the ghosts appear less often
	+ make the ghosts smaller

	Change and test your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
