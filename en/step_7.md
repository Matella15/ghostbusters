+ Can you give your player 10 seconds to catch as many ghosts as possible?

	Add the timer to the __stage__. This is how the timer should work:

	+ The timer should start at 10 seconds;
	+ The timer should count down every second;
	+ The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

__When the green flag is clicked__ your time __variable__ should be set to 10. It should then __change by -1__ every second __until__ it reaches 0.

+ Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score? If your game is too easy, you can:

	+ Give the player less time;
	+ Make the ghosts appear less often;
	+ Make the ghosts smaller.

	Test your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
